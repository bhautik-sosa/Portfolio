During my internship at CodersCave, I successfully completed a portfolio website project. The website showcases my skills, experiences, and projects in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. It includes sections for my bio, resume, projects, and contact information, demonstrating my proficiency in web development and design. The portfolio serves as a professional platform to highlight my achievements and attract potential employers or clients.
